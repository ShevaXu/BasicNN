The basic neural network implementation according to the UFLDL tutorial (http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial).

Dependencies:
  OpenCV (using 2.4.5 for VC project, only core, imgproc and highgui modules)
  Matlab (for mat related lib, including libmx.lib, libmex.lib and libmat.lib)

Also adopts the MxArray class implementation (now part of the mexopencv https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv).

Project started on 2013/4/6, cleaned up on 2014/4/22.
